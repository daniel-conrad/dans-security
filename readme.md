# Introduction
Hey there folks - I'm Daniel, and these are my security projects & publications. Here I'll post a variety of different things that you may find of use (or not), and may occasionally post blurbs on recent security news. I got into cyber security the first time I built a LAMP web server out of an old Dell Optiplex 990 and dropped it in a DMZ - genius, I know - only to find a myriad of SSH login attempts within minutes. Thus sparked my security adventure. I really enjoy educating others with information I've learned along the way, and I am continuously learning and seeking to further educate myself. All that being said, enjoy the content below.

# Projects
### OSIPS IP Analysis
This is a simple Python program that utilizes Virus Total, AbuseIPDB, and IPVoid. You'll need API keys for all of them to successfully run this program. Simply plug in your API keys into the config file, and run the .py program. Keep both files in the same directory, since it's built to reference the config file directly. After running the program and inputting your desired IP address, it will create an Excel file in the same directory with the results for you to view.
